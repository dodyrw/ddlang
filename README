  ddlang is a simple php language engine inspired by
  gettext. It use gettext language file (.po) with 
  no difference. So gettext tools like poedit still
  can be used.
  
  However ddlang is so simple. As simple as looking
  up an array of string then replace it with the correct
  match of translated language.

  The main difference with gettext is that it doesn't
  need to compile .po file to .mo file (binary). ddlang
  read the language file directly and construct an array
  called $ddlang.
  
  Thank you for using ddlang!
